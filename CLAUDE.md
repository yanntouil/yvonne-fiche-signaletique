# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a React TypeScript application called "Fiche Signalétique" - a form management system that allows users to create, manage, and organize multiple forms with persistent data storage. The app can run as a web application, PWA, or Electron desktop app. The application is deployed on Vercel for production use.

### Business Purpose
The application is used to create identification sheets ("fiches signalétiques") that are stored in local storage for printing purposes. Once printed, these sheets provide collaborators with all necessary information at hand to perform their work efficiently. The primary workflow is:
1. Create and fill out forms with client/participant information
2. Store data locally in the browser
3. Print the forms for field use by collaborators

## Key Commands

### Development
- `npm run dev` - Start Vite development server
- `npm run build` - Build production bundle (used by Vercel for deployment)
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint (fails on warnings)

### Electron Desktop App
- `npm run build-electron` - Build Electron main process
- `npm start` - Build and start Electron app

## Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **React 18** with TypeScript for UI
- **Vite** for bundling and dev server
- **Tailwind CSS** + **Shadcn/UI** for styling
- **@dnd-kit** for drag-and-drop functionality
- **Electron** for desktop app packaging
- **vite-plugin-pwa** for PWA support

### Code Structure
- `src/App.tsx` - Main application entry point with form state management
- `src/components/Entete.tsx` - Header component with form list management
- `src/components/Formulaire.tsx` - Main form component with all form fields
- `src/components/ui/` - Shadcn/UI component library
- `src/hooks/usePersistedState.ts` - Custom hook for localStorage persistence
- `src/lib/utils.ts` - Utility functions (mainly for className merging)

### Data Model
Forms are stored as an array of `FicheSignaletique` objects with:
- Basic info (name, date, email, phone)
- Room payments (`paiementChambres`)
- Baggage services (`bagages`)
- Dinner services (`dinerPayes`)
- Comments and administrative notes

All form data is persisted to localStorage using the `usePersistedState` hook.

## Important Notes

### No Testing Framework
This project currently has no testing setup. When implementing features:
- Manually test in the browser
- Test drag-and-drop functionality
- Verify localStorage persistence
- Check print layout functionality

### Code Style
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling - avoid inline styles
- Components use Shadcn/UI patterns
- TypeScript strict mode is enabled
- ESLint is configured to fail on warnings

### Form Management
- Forms are managed via `fiches` state array in App.tsx
- Each form has a unique `id` generated with `Date.now()`
- Forms can be reordered via drag-and-drop
- Active form is tracked with `ficheActuelle` state

### Printing
The app includes print-specific styles. When modifying the form layout, test the print preview to ensure proper formatting. Printing is a critical feature as it's the primary output method for collaborators to use the information in the field.
